# Awesome Books
"Awesome books" is a simple fully functional website that displays a list of books and allows you to add and remove books from that list. This application is built using Single Page Application concept where three links added on top of the page: List, Create and Contact. When the user clicks on any of the three links, the main area changes to display only one of the three content sections.
